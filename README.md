# Writing programs (or programming) is a very creative and rewarding activity.
You can write programs for many reasons, ranging from making your living to solving a difficult data analysis problem to having fun to helping someone else solve a problem. This repo assumes that everyone needs to know how to program, and that once you know how to program you will figure out what you want to do with your newfound skills.
With Object Oriented programming(OOP), we explored simple variables as well as collection data structures like lists, tuples, and dictionaries.
As we build programs, we design data structures and write code to manipulate those data structures. There are many ways to write programs and by now, you probably have written some programs that are “not so elegant” and other programs that are “more elegant”. Even though your programs may be small, you are starting to see how there is a bit of “art” and “aesthetic” to writing code.
